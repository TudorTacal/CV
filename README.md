I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in business development. I specialize in high performance web applications with a an emphasis on beautiful design, thus great UX. I promote quality code, speed and performance. From day 1 I promise to bring a great positive attitude, high energy, focus, hard work and lots of motivation and determination to succeed. 

My biggest technical achievement so far, was the 2 week final project at Makers Academy. There, I had the opportunity to apply all my skills, energy and knwodlege that I acquired in the last 4 months, to build a solid web application together with 3 colleagues who shared some common values such as: **focus**, **productivity** and **fun**. I started by brainstorming a project idea that would **solve a problem**, would use a cutting edge technology stack (**MERN**) and would be fun to use. Our [**Standups and Retros**](http://standupsandretros.herokuapp.com/) app does all this. That was a major success and we all feel very proud about the work we produced. 

Now, I am very excited to join a company where I will work on high performing scalable web applications, in an collaboratively environment, with friendly, fun, focused, and positive people who really care about the results they produce. I am an advocate of Agile so I value if these processes are used.


## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my career communication played a massive role in the success of my development. The biggest benefit I've drawn from proper communication is a **positive attitude**.

I was fortunate to play a leadership role for the final project at Makers Academy. I had to pitch the idea to my colleagues and form a strong team around it. I had a clear vision about the technologies involved. Those were **MongoDB**, **ExpressJS**, **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**. Plus integrating **websockets** for realtime communication. I wanted a **high performance** web application, **mobile friendly** but also a cool **UI**. By expressing myself with friendliness, respect and empathy I managed to reduce the most complex problems to easy understandable concepts while developing at Makers Academy.

Presenting with clarity and concision I've held highly technical product demostrations to non-technical clients when working at StreamAMG. The biggest challenge was to read if the client really understood what was going on or just nodded in agreement. This involved asking guiding questions and careful active listening for the slightest feedback regarding the product. 

From my point of view communication and interpersonal skills are one of the biggest assets a professional must possess, no matter the industry he works in. As I have seen entire businesses and departments being successful or being disrupted by the actions of a single individual. 


#### Team Work & Pairing

I am highly adaptable to any environment. I start slowly, take my time to observe and analyse the system and once I understand how it works I relentlessly increase my contribution in small increments. In the last 3 years I have worked across multiple teams in different industries being both leader and follower, be it as a business owner while coordinating the members of my team or as a junior technical account manager, learning the ropes of the exciting world of online video. 

Since I moved in the UK I had the opportunity to collaborate with people from all over the world and assured that principles like: *respect*, *motivation* and *productivity* are universally appreciated regardless of the country or company. When my colleagues from StreamAMG told me that *I motivated the entire team to learn to code* and that I was an example of self improvement and determination I was very grateful because it meant I could make a difference despite of the junior position and the short time spent there.

Last at Makers Academy, the *ultimate team work environment*, I found myself under the perfect conditions to learn the complex and ever evolving web development technologies together with an entire community of like minded people. And it was a thrill!
