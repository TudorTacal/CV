I am a junior web developer with a background in business development. I have moved to London solely to join the tech scene and continue my career as a web developer. My plan included Makers Academy, a full time, highly selective and very intensive coding bootcamp, as a launchpad for learning fast the newest technologies, the best practices used in the industry and becoming a part of an amazing community.    

Up to this point I have faced the troubled waters of entrepreneurship by building and managing 2 small businesses in my home country, Romania. This experience has been of tremendous value because it showed me what it means to be the leader and exposed me to an evironment of uncertainity and never ending problems that pushed me consitently to find solutions and move forward. After intense analysis I decided to get into tech, my original passion, and where to do it better than in London, Europe's technology capital.     

Now I am very excited to join a company where I will work on scalable web apps, in an collaboratively environment, with friendly people who really care about the results they produce. Perhaps a well established digital agency would be the perfect match but the entrepreneur in would also prefer a solid startup. Either way, my goals are to continuously improve the value that I am bringing to the company and to nurture meaningful relationships with my colleagues.
