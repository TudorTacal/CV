I am a software engineer with a passion for business. I specialize in high-performance web applications with an emphasis on UI and delivery. So far I have built and delivered to production 2 projects being part of self managed Agile teams. I promote quality code, speed,  performance, communication and getting things done.

Although my heart lies with ReactJS I have worked across the full stack since the beginning of my journey. Lately I find myslef more involved with delivering the products to the clients, that means DevOps, pipelines and AWS. 

A few words that characterize myself are: a great positive attitude, high energy, focus, hard work, determination to succeed, focus on delivery.

My favourite environment would use Agile practices, Lean principles, self managed teams, an open culture and continuous delivery. Having a Scrum Master mentality I belive I can bring a positive touch to any team, no matter of the tech stack or project phase. 

## Skills

### Tech

I consider myself a full stack engineer although I do have my favourites like ReactJS and the surrounding technologies. Some of the technologies I've worked with so far are:

Languages and frameworks: JavaScript, ReactJS(Webpack, Babel), ASP.NET Core (2.0) MVC, C# NodeJS, Java, Dropwizzard, Ruby ,Ruby on Rails, XML.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Git version control, Jenkins, GoCD, pipelines to make complex build workflows easy.

Platforms and Infrastructure: AWS, Terraform, Ansible, experiments using Docker & Kubernetes.

Tests automation tools and frameworks: Jasmine, Karma, Jest, NUnit, XUnit.

Databases: DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

Monitoring tools: Splunk, CloudWatch, Piwik, Kibana, Logstash, Google Analytics.

Looking forward to the blockchain stack: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity, dApps.

### Project Management

During my work in the Workflows team at LexisNexis, I have volunteered to be the Scrum Master in a time of massive change towards Agile methodologies & Lean principles.

Embracing the opportunity to work closely with the PO and tech lead and gave me a clear understanding on how a self managed development team should work in order to deliver successfuly.  

I then applied all my knowledge about sprints, product, standups, retros, backlog management, velocity, positive interaction with the nearby stakeholders, team motivation and many other principles in the other teams I have worked with. 

### Communication

I express myself with clarity and confidence making sure the interlocuters are engaged and on the same page. In general, and when pairing in particular, I find it easy to express my thought process and acurately articulate my ideas. 

I take great pleasure in having 1-1's, feedback sessions, presenting, showcasing and everything related to human interactions. I am not afraid to ask dificult questions and from the feedback gathered it seems that I doing quite a good job.

At Lexis Nexis I made deliberate efforts to improve my communication skills, learning from our ThoughtWorks colleagus, who paid incredible attention to each word and it's impact especially during product demonstrations. At Makers I had to pitch an idea for the final project which got chosen and so far in my career I always had to present, persuade or sell.


### Best practices: Teamwork, Pair programming, Problem solving & Learning new technologies

I am highly adaptable to any environment but I prefer the XP values. All my technical work has been done in teams, be it Lexis Nexis, Makers Academy or StreamAMG. I thrive and prefer a well rounded team comprised of devs, tech lead, PO, QA's and with occasional support from PM's, architects, etc.

I like to do pair programming especially when I am working with new technologies or when I am helping somebody pick up a new technology. I believe it just knocks the time spent on the learning curve and makes the code much better. I do all styles: ping pong, unstructured, time based, test based, mob programming, etc. Sometimes, I do prefer to work on my own, in particular when I know exactly what I am doing, I just like to get in the zone and iterate.

When it comes to problem solving I use the scientific method. I like to make assumptions and validate them. I then break the big problem into smaller, more approachable problems. My guiding question is: "What's the smallest step I can do to solve this problem ?". Other strategies I employ are: accurate and persistent research(Google is your friend), adequate questions, fast iterations and I am not afraid to engage other colleagues from different teams. 

Because of the nature of our craft, I can state with confidence that I am able to learn any technology stack and get a solid grasp of the basics in under one month, with the right guidance and environment. Be it React, Asp.NET, Java, Docker or SQL.


### Teamwork & Pairing

I am highly adaptable to any environment. I start slowly, take my time to observe and analyze the system and then I relentlessly increase my contribution in small increments. I believe one of the biggest values that I can bring to a team are motivation, excitement, and energy.

During the final project at Makers, we just took teamwork to a whole new level. We changed pairs daily, began with a stand-up and finished with a retro. We even delegated work for the weekend. The feedback loop was incredible and no matter how hard the challenge was, I was constantly repeating to my team *We'll get this done. We'll find a way*. And so we did.

### Problem solving

I use the scientific method to almost every aspect of my life, be it coding, nutrition or human relations. I approach problem-solving by first identifying the problem and then breaking it into smaller, more approachable problems.

The strategies that I employ to solve problems and for debugging are: accurate research, adequate questions and fast iterations. 


### Learning new technologies

It's amazing to see our progress, we started from the [command line](https://github.com/TudorTacal/clmystery) in the precourse and finished with deploying a complex web application on Heroku.

Every week we had to learn a new language, framework, library, best practice or design pattern. This has made me to become tech agnostic. To showcase this, I learned the basics of the MERN stack in just 4 days for my final project. 

I can state with confidence that I am able to learn any technology stack and get a solid grasp of the basics in under one month, with the right guidance and environment.
