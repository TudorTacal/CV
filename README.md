[Skills](#skills) | [Projects](#projects) | [Experience](#experience)| [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)


I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in business development. I specialize in high-performance web applications with an emphasis on **beautiful design**, thus great **UX**. I promote **quality code**, **speed**, and **performance**.

From day 1 I promise to bring a great **positive attitude**, **high energy**, focus, hard work and determination to succeed alongside my [technical skills](#projects). My colleagues from Makers told me I am the most cheerful person there and I believe it's hard to find a more **motivated** and **ambitious** person than me. 

Now, I am very excited to join a company where I will work on **high-performing scalable web applications**, in a collaborative environment, with **friendly**, fun, **focused**, and positive people who really care about the results they produce. I am an advocate of **Agile** so I value if these processes are used.**Pair programming**, **test driven development**, and support to become a **well-rounded technologist** are also big plusses.


## Skills

### Communication

I was fortunate to play a leadership role for the [final project](https://github.com/TudorTacal/makers-standups-retros) at Makers Academy. I had to pitch the idea to my colleagues and **unite** a strong team around it. I had a clear **vision** about the technologies involved. I believe the **interpersonal skills** are one of the biggest assets a professional must possess.

Presenting with **clarity** and **concision** I've held highly technical **product demonstrations** to non-technical clients when working at **StreamAMG**. 


### Teamwork & Pairing

I am highly **adaptable** to any environment. I start slowly, take my time to observe and analyze the system and once I understand how it works I relentlessly increase my contribution in small increments.I believe one of the biggest values that I can bring to a team are **motivation**, **excitement**, and **energy**.

During the final project at Makers, we just took teamwork to a whole new level. We **changed pairs** daily, began with a **stand-up** and finished with a **retro**. We even delegated work for the weekend. The **feedback loop** was incredible, we were communicating our progress constantly and no matter how hard the challenge or the blocks were, I was always repeating to my team *We'll get this done. We'll find a way*. And so we did.

### Problem solving

I use the **scientific method** to almost every aspect of my life, be it coding, nutrition or human relations. I approach problem-solving by first identifying the problem and then **breaking** it into smaller, more approachable problems.

The strategies that I employ to solve problems and for **debugging** are: **accurate research**, **adequate questions** and **fast iterations**. 


### Learning new technologies

It's amazing to see our progress, we started from the [command line](https://github.com/TudorTacal/clmystery) in the precourse and finished with deploying a **complex web application** on Heroku.

Every week we had to learn a new language, framework, library, best practice or design pattern. This has made me to become **tech agnostic**. To showcase this, I learned the basics of the **MERN** stack in just 2 days for my final project. 

I can state with confidence that I am able to **learn any technology stack** and get a solid grasp of the basics in under one month, with the right guidance and environment.
