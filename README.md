[Skills](#skills) | [Projects](#projects) | [Experience](#experience)| [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)


I am a software engineer with a passion for business and winning. I specialize in high-performance web applications with an emphasis on UI and delivery. So far I have built and delivered to production 2 projects being part of self-managed Agile teams. I promote quality code, speed,  performance, communication and getting things done.

Although my heart lies with ReactJS I have worked across the full stack since the beginning of my journey. Lately, I find myself more involved with delivering the applications, that means DevOps, pipelines, and AWS. 

A few words that characterize me: a great positive attitude, high energy, focus, hard work, determination to succeed, software delivery.

My favorite environment would use Agile practices, Lean principles, self-managed teams, an open culture and continuous delivery. Having a Scrum Master mentality I believe I can bring a positive touch to any team, no matter of the tech stack or project phase. But I would prefer to work with ReactJS, ASP.Net Core, AWS and the blockchain.

## Skills

### Tech

Some of the technologies I've worked with so far are:

Languages and frameworks: JavaScript, ReactJS(Webpack, Babel), ASP.NET Core (2.0) MVC, C# NodeJS, Java, Dropwizzard, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, XML.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Git version control, Jenkins, GoCD, pipelines to make complex build workflows easy.

Platforms and Infrastructure: AWS, Terraform, Ansible, experiments using Docker & Kubernetes.

Tests automation tools and frameworks: Jasmine, Karma, Jest, NUnit, XUnit, JUnit.

Databases: DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.

Monitoring tools: Splunk, CloudWatch, Piwik, Kibana, Logstash, Google Analytics.

Looking forward to the blockchain stack: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity, dApps.

### Project Management

During my work in the Workflows team at LexisNexis, I have volunteered to become the Scrum Master in a time of massive change towards Agile methodologies & Lean principles.

Embracing the opportunity to work closely with the PO and tech lead gave me a clear understanding of how a self-managed development team should work in order to deliver successfully.  

I then applied all my knowledge about sprints, product, standups, retros, backlog management, velocity, positive interaction with the nearby stakeholders, team motivation and many other principles in the other teams I have worked with like Curta and The Redactor.

### Communication

I express myself with clarity and confidence making sure the interlocutors are engaged and we are on the same page. In general, and when pairing in particular, I find it easy to express my thought process and acurately articulate my ideas. 

I take great pleasure in having 1-1's, feedback sessions, presenting, showcasing and everything related to human interactions & sharing knowledge. I am not afraid to ask difficult questions and from the feedback gathered it seems that I am doing quite a good job.

At Lexis Nexis I made deliberate efforts to improve my communication skills, learning from our ThoughtWorks colleagues, who paid incredible attention to each word and the impact it generated especially during product demonstrations. Finishing Makers Academy I had to pitch an idea for the final project which got chosen and so far in my career I always had to present, persuade or sell.


### Best practices: Teamwork, Pair programming, Problem-solving & Learning new technologies

I am highly adaptable to any environment but I prefer the XP values. All my technical work has been done in teams, be it Lexis Nexis, Makers Academy or StreamAMG. I thrive in a well-rounded team comprised of devs, tech lead, PO, QA's and with occasional support from PM's, architects, and/or other relevant people.

I like to do pair programming especially when I work with new technologies or when I am helping somebody else pick up a new technology. I believe it just obliterates the learning curve and makes the code much better. I can accommodate all styles: driver-navigator, ping pong, unstructured, time based, test-based, mob programming, etc. Sometimes, I do prefer to work on my own, in particular when I know exactly what I am doing, I just like to get in the zone and get things done.

When it comes to problem-solving I use the scientific method. I like to make assumptions and validate them. I then break the big problem into smaller, more approachable problems. My guiding question is: "What's the smallest step I can do to solve this problem ?". Other strategies I employ are: accurate and persistent research(Google is your friend), adequate questions, fast iterations and I do engage other colleagues from different teams. 

Because of the nature of our craft, I can state with confidence that I am able to learn any technology stack and get a solid grasp of the basics in under one month, with the right guidance and environment. Be it React, Asp.NET, Java, Docker or SQL.

## Experience

**Lexis Nexis**
*Software Engineer* 

* During my time at Lexis Nexis, I worked in 5 agile teams, with people from ThoughtWorks and LexisNexis, using a large stack of cutting-edge technologies such as ReactJs, Redux, DotNet Core(2.00), AWS, machine learning, AI, Docker, Kubernetes, and many others.

* Together we built and delivered robust, scalable and very secure web applications for the legal domain, many of which involved highly sensitive information. I also had the opportunity to get involved in project management and when the time was right I became a certified Scrum Master and played that role on a daily basis. 

* Moving our solutions to AWS I had to work with services such as: EC2, S3, Elastic search, DynamoDb, CloudWatch but also learnt about creating environments using Terraform, provisioning with Ansible, CI/CD tools like Jenkins & GoCd where I wrote pipelines as code, networking concepts like VPC, CIDR, private/public subnets, NAT gateway, Internet gateway, regions, zones, VPC peering, how to build and deploy to production but also restrict developer access once everything is created and deployed.

**StreamAMG** (May 2016 to October 2016)    
*Junior Technical Account Manager*
* Coordinated webcasting projects for companies like Hachette, Target Ovarian Cancer, IFoA, P&O Ferries, Homeserve, and Linkedin. Offered technical assistance for the VOD platform and held regular product demonstrations at the head office and online.

* Designed, built and adapted the microsites used for registering and viewing the webcasts. For this I used HTML5 and CSS3, which I learned by myself from online resources such as [Team Treehouse](teamtreehouse.com), [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). 

**The Forge** (September 2015 to April 2016)   
*Assistant Manager*
* Assisted the management in virtually every process that was required. After a brief period of adjustment, I was regularly left in charge of managing the operations and staff while the management was not present in the hotel.  

**Pronovia Gym** (June 2014 to September 2015)   
*Owner|Business Development Manager*
* Designed the business starting from writing the business plan to renting a space, building the gym and having our first clients.

**Elsanta Strawberry** (July 2014 to August 2015)
*Owner|Business Development Manager*

## Interests

Health and wellbeing have high priority in my life.
Some activities I enjoy are fitness, biking, skiing, swimming, running and I rarely refuse an adventure/challenge.
At Makers Academy I was proclaimed table tennis guru :)
I like to read about tech, personal development, spirituality and try to meditate at least a couple of times per week. 
Future technologies, startups, business and financial freedom strategies are always a preferred conversation topic.
Moving forward I am excited at the prospect of becoming a parent.
