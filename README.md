I am a junior web developer with a background in business development.  I have moved to London solely to join the tech scene and pursue a career as a web developer. My plan included Makers Academy, a full time, higly selective and very intensive coding bootcamp that would allow me to learn fast a new skill set and enable me to bring more value to my future company.    

Prior to that I created and managed 3 small businesses in my home country, Romania. These consisted of a group exercise studio, a modern strawberry planation and a mountain guess house. I am an engineer at heart and posess a genuine passion for everything computer related. Actually my first computer only had a monitor and keyboard where i had to insert diskettes to run programs.  Although i didn't have any previous technical work experience I managed to secure a postition as a technical account manager with StreamAMG, a company that provides online video solutions, in just a few weeks after moving to London. 

Now I am very excited to join a company where I can work on different projects, in an collaboratively environment, with friendly people who really care about the results they produce. My goals are to continuously improve the value that I am bringing to the company and nurture meaningful relationships with my colleagues.

Health and wellbeing have high priority in my life. For exercise I prefer fitnes, biking, skiing, swimming, running and never refuse an adventure. 
I like to read about personal development, philosophy, spirituality and try to meditate at least a couple of times per week. 
Moving forward I am excited at the prospect of becoming a parent.
