[Skills](#skills) | [Projects]() | [Experience](#experience)| [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)


I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in business development. I specialize in high-performance web applications with an emphasis on **beautiful design**, thus great **UX**. I promote **quality code**, **speed**, and **performance**.

From day 1 I promise to bring a great positive attitude, high energy, focus, hard work and determination to succeed alongside my technical skills. My colleagues from Makers told me I am the most cheerful person there and I believe it's hard to find a more motivated and ambitious person than me. I just make all sort of plans, short term, long term, work related, life related, and then iterate hard to accomplish them.

Now, I am very excited to join a company where I will work on **high-performing scalable web applications**, in a collaborative environment, with **friendly**, fun, **focused**, and positive people who really care about the results they produce. I am an advocate of **Agile** so I value if these processes are used.**Pair programming**, **test driven development**, and support to become a **well-rounded technologist** are also big plusses.


## Skills

#### Communication

I was fortunate to play a leadership role for the final project at Makers Academy. I had to pitch the idea to my colleagues and **unite** a strong team around it. I had a clear **vision** about the technologies involved. By expressing myself with friendliness, respect and empathy I managed to reduce the most complex problems to easily understandable concepts throughout my entire journey.

Presenting with **clarity** and **concision** I've held highly technical **product demonstrations** to non-technical clients when working at **StreamAMG**. The biggest challenge was to read if the client really understood what was going on or just nodded in agreement. This involved asking guiding questions and careful **active listening** for the slightest feedback regarding the product. 

From my point of view communication and **interpersonal skills** are one of the biggest assets a professional must possess, no matter the industry he works in. As I have seen entire businesses and departments being successful or being disrupted by the actions of a single individual. 

#### Teamwork & Pairing

I am highly **adaptable** to any environment. I start slowly, take my time to observe and analyze the system and once I understand how it works I relentlessly increase my contribution in small increments. In the last 4 years, I have worked across multiple teams in different industries being both leader and follower.

I love working in teams probably because I like working with people. Again the productivity and **results** increase exponentially when you have an entire team working together to solve a problem or build a new app or feature. I believe one of the biggest values that I can bring to a team are **motivation**, **excitement**, and **energy**.

During the final project at Makers, we just took teamwork to a whole new level. We **changed pairs** daily, began our day with a **stand-up** and finished with a **retro**. We even delegated work for the weekend. The **feedback loop** was just incredible, we were communicating our progress constantly and no matter how hard the challenge or the blocks were, I was always repeating to my team *We'll get this done. We'll find a way*. And so we did.

#### Problem solving

I use the **scientific method** to almost every aspect of my life, be it coding, nutrition or human relations. If you don't measure it, you can't grow it or improve it. 

I approach problem-solving by first identifying  the problem and **breaking** it into smaller, more approachable problems. I believe one of my best **strategies** when it comes to problem-solving is to **ask adequate questions**. I frequently ask myself, my pair or the team: *What is the next simplest step that we can tackle?*, *How will this change our situation?* , *What happens if we do this?*.

I have to admit that one of my successes solving coding problems and **debugging** is **fast iterations**. For example, one of the aspects that I took **responsibility** for in my final project was deploying to **Heroku**. I love to be **Agile** so I recommended that we should deploy to production fast. Thus in our third day, our app was live, we followed tutorials the first day to learn the new technology stack. Although we pushed to production at least once per day, as our app grew the problems started to appear.

The deployment process went like this:
*Make a change in code* -> *Test in the local environment* ->  *Make a commit* -> *Push to Github* -> *Push to Heroku*. We could easily make 10 commits for one problematic push. I had to iterate fast because time was scarce but still used the scientific method to correctly **isolate the problem** so that we learn how to do it properly next time.

#### Learning new technologies

Although I've been a passionate student all my life, Makers gave me a new vision about learning complex tech and how to do it. It's amazing to see our progress, we started from the command line in the precourse and finished with deploying a **complex web application** on Heroku.

Every week we had to learn a new language, framework, library, practice or design pattern. This has made me to become tech agnostic. To showcase this, I learned the basics of the **MERN** stack in just 2 days for my final project. 

I can state with confidence that I am able to **learn any technology stack** and get a solid grasp of the basics in under one month, with the right guidance and environment.
