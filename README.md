## Tudor Dan Tacal

I am a technology enthusiast with a background in business development.  I have moved to London to join the tech scene and pursue a career as a web developer. My plan included Makers Academy, a full time, higly selective and very intensive coding bootcamp that would allow me to learn fast a new skill set and enable me to bring more value to my future company.    

Prior to that i created and ran 3 small businesses in my home country, Romania. These consisted of a group exercise studio, a modern strawberry planation and a mountain guess house., i am an engineer at heart and posess a genuine passion for everything computer related. Actually my first computer only had a monitor and keyboard where i had to insert diskettes to run programs.  Although i didn't have any previous technical work experience I managed to secure a postition as a technical account manager with StreamAMG, a company that provides online video solutions, in just a few weeks after moving to London. 

Now i am looking forward to a junior web developer position where i can work on different projects with a clear start-end date, in an collaboratively environment, with friendly people who really care about the work they produce and are excited about life.

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.
