[Skills](#skills) | [Projects](#projects) | [Experience](#experience)| [Education](#education) | [Interests](#interests)

I am a software engineer with a passion for business and winning. I specialize in high-performance web applications with an emphasis on UI and delivery. I promote quality code, speed, performance, communication and getting things done.

Although my heart lies with ReactJS I have worked across the full stack since the beginning of my journey. Lately, I find myself more involved with DevOps work.

My favorite environment would use Agile practices, Lean principles, self-managed teams, an open culture and continuous delivery. Being a Scrum Master I believe I can bring a positive touch to any team, no matter of the tech stack or project phase. But I would prefer to work with ReactJS, ASP.Net Core, AWS and the blockchain.

#### Skills

##### Tech
Some of the technologies I've worked with so far: Languages and frameworks: JavaScript, ReactJS(Webpack, Babel), ASP.NET Core (2.0) MVC, C# NodeJS, Java, Dropwizzard, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, XML. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery: Git version control, Jenkins, GoCD, pipelines to make complex build workflows easy. Platforms and Infrastructure: AWS, Terraform, Ansible, experiments using Docker & Kubernetes. Tests automation tools and frameworks: Jasmine, Karma, Jest, NUnit, XUnit, JUnit. Databases: DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL. Monitoring tools: Splunk, CloudWatch, Piwik, Kibana, Logstash, Google Analytics.  Looking forward to the blockchain stack: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solidity, dApps.

##### Project Management

During my time with the Workflows team at LexisNexis, I have volunteered to become the Scrum Master in a time of massive change towards Agile methodologies & Lean principles. Embracing the opportunity to work closely with the PO and tech lead gave me a clear understanding of how a self-managed development team should work in order to deliver successfully.  

##### Communication

I express myself with clarity and confidence making sure the interlocutors are engaged and everyone is on the same page. In general, and when pairing in particular, I find it easy to express my thought process and acurately articulate my ideas. I take great pleasure in having 1-1's, feedback sessions, presenting, showcasing and everything related to human interactions & sharing knowledge. I like to ask good questions and from the feedback gathered it seems that I am doing quite a good job.

At Lexis Nexis I made deliberate efforts to improve my communication skills, learning from our ThoughtWorks colleagues, who paid incredible attention to each word and the impact it generated especially during product demonstrations.

##### Best practices: Teamwork, Pair programming, Problem-solving & Learning new technologies

All my technical work has been done in teams, be it Lexis Nexis, Makers Academy or StreamAMG. I thrive in a well-rounded team comprised of devs, tech lead, PO, QA's and with occasional support from PM's, architects, and/or other relevant people.

I like to do pair programming especially when I work with new technologies or when I am helping somebody else pick up a new technology. Sometimes, I do prefer to work on my own, in particular when I know exactly what I am doing, I just like to get in the zone and get things done. When it comes to problem-solving I use the scientific method. I like to make assumptions and validate them. I then break the big problem into smaller, more approachable problems. My guiding question is: "What's the smallest step I can do to solve this problem ?".

##### Experience

**Lexis Nexis**
*Software Engineer*

* During my time at Lexis Nexis, I worked in 5 agile teams, with people from ThoughtWorks and LexisNexis, using a large stack of cutting-edge technologies such as ReactJs, Redux, DotNet Core(2.00), AWS, machine learning, AI, Docker, Kubernetes, and many others.

* Together we built and delivered robust, scalable and very secure web applications for the legal domain, many of which involved highly sensitive information. I also had the opportunity to get involved in project management and when the time was right I became a certified Scrum Master and played that role on a daily basis.

* Moving our solutions to AWS I became familiar with services such as: EC2, S3, Elastic search, DynamoDb, CloudWatch, KMS. But also learnt about creating environments using Terraform, provisioning with Ansible, CI/CD tools like Jenkins & GoCd(pipelines as code), networking concepts like VPC, CIDR, private/public subnets, NAT gateways, Internet gateways, regions, zones, VPC peerings.

**StreamAMG** (May 2016 to October 2016)    
*Junior Technical Account Manager*
* Coordinated webcasting projects for companies like Hachette, Target Ovarian Cancer, IFoA, P&O Ferries, Homeserve, and Linkedin. Offered technical assistance for the VOD platform and held regular product demonstrations at the head office and online.

* Designed, built and adapted the microsites used for registering and viewing the webcasts. For this I used HTML5 and CSS3, which I learned by myself from online resources such as [Team Treehouse](teamtreehouse.com), [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

**The Forge** (September 2015 to April 2016)   
*Assistant Manager*
* Assisted the management in virtually every process that was required. After a brief period of adjustment, I was regularly left in charge of managing the operations and staff while the management was not present in the hotel.  

**Pronovia Gym** (June 2014 to September 2015)   
*Owner|Business Development Manager*

#### Interests

Health and wellbeing have high priority in my life. Some activities I enjoy are fitness, biking, skiing, swimming, running and I rarely refuse an adventure/challenge. At Makers Academy I was proclaimed table tennis guru :) I like to read about tech, personal development, spirituality and try to meditate at least a couple of times per week. Future technologies, startups, business and financial freedom strategies are always a preferred conversation topic. Moving forward I am excited at the prospect of becoming a parent.
